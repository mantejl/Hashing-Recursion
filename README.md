# Hashing-Recursion 

 C++ implementation of a hash function for strings using a custom hashing technique that is used in 
 a hash table with support for linear and double hashing probing techniques, and the Boggle game, which involves finding words on a letter grid.
 Performs a recursive depth-first search on the board, exploring different paths to form valid words.
